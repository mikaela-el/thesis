## From the Supreme Court to the States: Visualizing Womenâ€™s Reproductive Rights  

#### Throughout history, both the Supreme Court and lower levels of government have played essential roles in determining the extent to which women can legally access contraception and abortion. Making use of archival data collected by the Supreme Court as well as qualitative data about state abortion policy, this project seeks to investigate how decisions made at the Supreme Court level are implemented within the individual states.
