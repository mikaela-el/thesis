<!--Guste v. Jackson-->

<!--https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/429/399/#tab-opinion-1951977-->

<p>
    A Louisiana statute forbids performance of an abortion on a <a class="underline" href ="#below_age">minor</a> without her <a class="underline" href ="#parental_consent_required">parents' consent</a>, or her husband's consent if she is married. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana enjoined enforcement of the statute. Its decision discusses only these special requirements for abortions on minors, but the injunction appears to extend to the entire statute, and thus includes "informed consent" requirements applicable to all women. We vacate the injunction insofar as it bars enforcement of the "informed consent" requirements, and remand to the District Court so that it may consider the construction of those requirements, their validity in light of this Court's intervening decision in Planned Parenthood of Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 428 U. S. 65-67 (1976), and their severability from the remainder of the statute.
