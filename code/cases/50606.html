<h3>Facts of The Case</h3>

<p>Roe, a Texas resident, sought to <a href="#exception_life">terminate her pregnancy</a> by abortion. Texas law prohibited abortions except to save the pregnant woman's life. After granting certiorari, the Court heard arguments twice. The first time, Roe's attorney -- Sarah Weddington -- could not locate the constitutional hook of her argument for Justice Potter Stewart. Her opponent -- Jay Floyd -- misfired from the start. Weddington sharpened her constitutional argument in the second round. Her new opponent -- Robert Flowers -- came under strong questioning from Justices Potter Stewart and Thurgood Marshall.</p>

<!--<h3>Question</h3>-->

<!--<p>Does the Constitution embrace a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy by abortion?</p>-->

<!--<h3>Conclusion</h3>-->

<!--<p>The Court held that a woman's right to an abortion fell within the right to privacy (recognized in Griswold v. Connecticut) -->
<!--protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The decision gave a woman total autonomy over the pregnancy during the first trimester and -->
<!--defined different levels of state interest for the second and third trimesters. As a result, the laws of 46 states were affected by the Court's ruling.</p>-->
