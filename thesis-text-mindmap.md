### I’m visualizing the fertility of a female throughout her lifetime because I want to show the different choices they need to make and when, in order to help educate women about their bodies so they can make better informed decisions regarding their own fertility and sexual health. 

#### Research Guiding Questions

##### What do women need to know about their Fertility/ Reproduction?

##### What choices do women have to make?

##### When do women need to make these choices?

##### Are women being educated to make these choices?

##### How do these choices differ for women around the world?

##### Why is it important for women to be aware of choices surrounding their Fertility/ Reproduction/ sexual health?

##### How should female sexual health be addressed within educational institutions? When?

#### Why is This Important?

##### Fertility/ Reproduction/ Sexual health is considered taboo in most places and is not talked 

##### There is a lack of education on female reproduction and sexual health as well as a many differing opinions on the topic

##### Many sexual education programs are not based on science and do not focus on important topics for women 

##### A women’s sexual health/ fertility timeline differs drastically in different parts of the world 

##### As more women choose to have kids later in life, it is important to know options about egg freezing etc.  Should not have to feel pressured to have children and leave career early
